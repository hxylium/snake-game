This is a little intro to my project.

Main modules needed:
  - Pygame
  - Easygui_qt
  - Random


To play the game its simple.
For the controlling of the snake:
  - Use arrow keys
For pausing the game
  - Use the spacebar


Notes:
  - DO NOT touch any other file (you may though once you understand how the program is built), as some text files are fragile and can break the program!
  - This game a has seperate music for each different level to keep the user intertained with the harshness of the music matching
  - You can create your own 'User' and use that whenever you wish to play and it will keep your score forever
  - You can also choose what graphics you would like to play, but you only have two options, between a circle body and a rectangular body
  - You have multiple levels of difficulty with each level matching its supposed level of hardness, ranging from level 1 to Extreme
  - Extreme is only for pros with fast handmovments and precise knowledge of how the game works (so do your best ;))
  - Also if your reading this Schellenberg, scan the QR code (if you can find it) in the website I built for the HTML assignment. (Theres
a neat little surprise. And you can tell me all about it on my mail on 'ahyder@duck.com'.
  - Hope you like my project and hope you like my little surprise. You have honestly been a great teacher and are my favourite amongst the teachers I have met. Good luck with your career and wherever that may take you!
